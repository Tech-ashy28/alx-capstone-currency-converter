# ALX Capstone: Currency Converter

This is a simple **Currency Converter** built with React as part of my ALX Capstone Project.  
The app allows users to convert between different currencies using live exchange rates.

## Technologies Used
- **React** (frontend framework)
- **Vite** (fast build tool)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS3** (for styling)
- **Tailwind CSS** (optional, for responsive design)
- **ExchangeRate API** (for real-time currency data)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control)

## Features (Planned / In Progress)
- Select currencies and enter an amount to convert
- Fetch and display real-time exchange rates
- Show the latest rate update info
- Fully responsive UI (works on desktop & mobile)
