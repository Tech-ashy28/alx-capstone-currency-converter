# Currency Converter App  

This is my ALX capstone project. It is a web app that allows users to convert currencies using real-time exchange rates. The app is built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React** (with optional Tailwind CSS).  

## Features  
- Convert between different currencies  
- Real-time exchange rates from a public API  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile  
- Simple and clean user interface
